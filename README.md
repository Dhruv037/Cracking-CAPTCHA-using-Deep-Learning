# Cracking-CAPTCHA-using-Deep-Learning
A CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Human Apart), now a days which is commonly used in internet for security purpose. Due to Coomputer Vision techniques alpha-numeric CAPTCHA can be decoded efficiently. In this project, we are interested in testing the sensitivity and strength of alpha-numeric CAPTCHAs. We used Captch_Master open source software to create CAPTCHA images dataset and developed ML models that can depict the value written in a captcha. We developed decoders based on CNN, SVM and K-Means, and compared their efficiencies.
